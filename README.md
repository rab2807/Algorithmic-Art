# Algorithmic-Art
I make generative art using Processing, a open source graphical library based on Java.  The interesting thing about generative art is every time it runs, it creates a unique sketch. I find it very satisfying to set some simple rules and see something very beautiful emerging from those rules! To me, it is a perfect fusion of computation and art.
